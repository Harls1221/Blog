    <p>Welcome to my little brain dump zone!</p>
    
<h2>For those who feel like they are too old to learn code</h2>
    <p>When I decided to change my major from Early Childhood Education to Digital Media Tech, I was beyond excited and scared all at the same time. I first heard of coding a few years ago on a Facebook ad from Codecademy. They offer free coding lessons so I thought, why not? So I followed the lessons and found out that I actually liked it. But, I thought it was too late to change my major to Web Development. January 1, 2019 I decided it was now or never.    </p>

<h3>What I did not know before starting school</h3>
    <p>I started my Web Dev journey just after my 25th birthday. I registered for my first web dev course and picked up my book that will probably be my html and css bible for the years to come. If you do not know already, I graduated in a small town that was big on football and soccer. Coding was not offered at my high school. So, when I started my first WEb Dev course in college last semester, I will be honest here, I was a little discouraged. All of my fellow students are younger than me and had learned to code in High School. Here I am, 25 (Which is still a very young age to learn a new skill) and most of my classmates are not even 21 yet and know how to code! Don't get me wrong, it is amazong that they had the opportunity to learn while they were in Highschool.  But, still, I felt like I was already behind and I just started!</p>

<h3>This is not a race</h3>
    <p>It has taken me a long time to realize that I can't keep comparing myself to others. When I first started college in 2012, I met a woman in my Comp class who was well into her 60's maybe even 70's. I wish I could remember her name. Anyway, she introduced herself and told me that she always wanted to go back to school. Her kids are all grown and have lives of their own. Her and her husband were empty nesters. She was going to school to study Astrology! That memory of our conversation that particular day still encourages me to keep going. So, thank you Mrs. Astrology woman. Your words still inspire me 7 years later, and because of you I know that I am not behind and I am as capable as any to learn coding! </p>
